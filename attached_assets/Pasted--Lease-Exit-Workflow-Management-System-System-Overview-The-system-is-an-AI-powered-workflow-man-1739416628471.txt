# Lease Exit Workflow Management System
## System Overview

The system is an AI-powered workflow management platform specifically designed to handle lease exit processes. It utilizes Crew AI agents for orchestrating workflows and integrates with a persistent database for data storage.
Built using Crew AI, the system dynamically generates workflows, manages approvals, tracks progress, and automates notifications. The system will be designed for scalability, supporting future workflow automation such as Lease Renewals, New Lease Acquisitions, and Building Sales.

The AI-powered agent will generate workflow instances dynamically based on user input and a predefined schema, enabling users to construct applications via natural language prompts. The interface will allow users to interact with AI agents, monitor workflow progress, and manage lease exit details.

Focus mainly on building Crew AI agents pipeline with appropriate tasks and tools.
